Please comply with the following rules when hacking on Avahi:

 * Before committing check with "git st" that all built files are ignored
   by git. To change the list of ignored files use

       $VISUAL .gitignore

   This is similar to the ".cvsignore" file in CVS times.

 * Don't forget to add the autoconf config.h inclusion to all C source files:

   #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
   #include <config.h>
   #endif

   This needs to be placed in in .c files only. NOT IN HEADER FILES!

 * Don't hardcode any paths in source files. Either use the -D option of gcc
   for C sources or use "sed" to replace them based on a .in file.

 * Never forget that Avahi should be buildable without DBUS, GTK or python!

 * Before committing, test your code! In case of C consider running it
   a few times through valgrind, to make sure that you got everything
   right.  You have to call libtool explicitly when running valgrind
   on binaries that depend on shared objects. e.g.:

       libtool --mode=execute valgrind ./avahi-daemon

   Please note that valgrind can't find you all bugs. Please check
   your code thrice with your brain before committing. Valgrind is
   only a final check.

 * Whenever you add a new Makefile.am, C (.c or .h) source file, shell or
   python script please add this legal blurb to its header:

   For Makefile.am, python and shell code:
