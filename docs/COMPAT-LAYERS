Avahi 0.9.1 and above offer full API and ABI compatibility with Bonjour
out-of-the-box. To enable this you pass --enable-compat-libdns_sd to the
configure script. The build system installs a shared library libdns_sd.so.
These files might overwrite the original implementations, so take care!

Distributors that want full build system compatibility in addition to ABI/API
compatibility should:

	1) Symlink $(includedir)/avahi-compat-libdns_sd/dns_sd.h to
	$(includedir)/dns_sd.h
