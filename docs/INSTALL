*** Quick install instructions (tested on Debian/Ubuntu only!) ***

While "configure" and "make" may be run as normal user all other commands
need to be run as root.

Configure the build system:
	$ autoreconf -if
	$ ./configure \
            --libdir="/usr/lib/$(dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH)" \
            --localstatedir=/var \
            --prefix=/usr \
            --runstatedir=/run \
            --sysconfdir=/etc

It should be noted that it's suitable for testing purposes only.
The script configuring the actual Debian package can be found at
https://salsa.debian.org/utopia-team/avahi/-/blob/debian/master/debian/rules?ref_type=heads.
Among other things it also turns on the hardening flags described at
https://wiki.debian.org/Hardening.

Build and install avahi:
	$ make
	# make install
	# ldconfig

Add a user and a group for avahi. (Debian specific)
	# addgroup --system avahi
	# adduser --system --no-create-home --ingroup avahi avahi

Ask D-Bus to re-read its policies:
	# systemctl reload dbus

Now start the Avahi daemon:
	# systemctl start avahi-daemon

Optionally start the unicast DNS configuration daemon:
	# systemctl start avahi-dnsconfd

To start the two daemons at boot time on Debian based distributions:
	# systemctl enable avahi-daemon
	# systemctl enable avahi-dnsconfd

If you plan to use avahi-autoipd you have to create the user/group
"avahi-autoipd" much the same way as "avahi".
